Description of dataset

About the Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The dataset contains records for female patients of Pima Indian heritage, all of whom are at least 21 years old  of Pima Indian heritage.2

From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

Column Information:

•	Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.

•	Glucose: Glucose level in blood.

•	Age: Age of the patient.

•	Outcome: Final result (1 is Yes, 0 is No).
